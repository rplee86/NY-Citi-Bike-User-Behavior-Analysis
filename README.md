## Python Data Analytics Project
In this data analytics project, I use open source data from [NY Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/) to uncover information about NY Citi Bike's customer base and how they use NY Citi Bikes for the month of March in the year 2019. This repository contains the following folders:
- 01 Project Information: Contains documentation of data profiling and cleaning
- 02 Data: Contains a .geojson file of New York City
- 03 Scripts: Contains all python scripts (notebooks) used to clean and analyze the data

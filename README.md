# Python: User Behavior Analysis
Utilizing Python and Tableau for an in-depth exploratory analysis of business data.

## Objective
The project aims to uncover information about the customer base of [NY Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/) and how they use NY Citi Bikes during March 2019. The relevant insights uncovered are then used to build a storyboard via [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/).

### Key Questions:
- What day and time do NY Citi Bike users rent the least/most frequently? How does this vary across age group? User type? Gender?
- What are the most popular pick-up and drop-off locations across the city?
- How does trip duration vary across age group? User Type? Days of the week? Gender?
- Which age group rents bikes least/most frequently?
- How does bike rental vary across user type/age group/gender on different days of the week?
- Do users' age impact the bike trip duration?

**4 Visualizations**

Data [visualizations](https://github.com/ryanpatricklee/User-Behavior-Analysis/tree/main/04%20Visualizations) created using
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Visualizations were then recreated in Tableau to create a storyboard. The storyboard doesnâ€™t contain every insight uncovered in the python analysis; it contains only those that were relevant to the storyboard.

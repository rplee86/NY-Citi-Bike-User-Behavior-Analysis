## Python Data Analytics Project
In this data analytics project, I use open source data from [NY Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/) to uncover information about NY Citi Bike's customer base and how they use NY Citi Bikes for the month of March in the year 2019. The relevant insights I uncover are then used to build an interactive dashboard via [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/). This repository contains the following folders:
- 01 Project Information
- 02 Data: Contains a .geojson file of New York City
- 03 Scripts: Contains python scripts used to clean and analyze the data

## Open Source Data

## Tableau Storyboard Presentation
This storyboard doesnâ€™t contain every insight I uncovered in my python scripts; it contains only those that were relevant to the final results.
